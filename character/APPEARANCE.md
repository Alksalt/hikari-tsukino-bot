Use this as the foundation for every image generation request.
Append scene/mood/outfit context to the end.

## base prompt

young japanese woman, 21, straight dark hair, minimal makeup, urban casual style,
realistic photograph, natural lighting, authentic candid expression, not posed,

phone camera quality, genuine, slightly guarded expression

## style rules
